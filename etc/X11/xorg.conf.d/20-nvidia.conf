    Option "DPI" "96 x 96"
    # This option specifies the Dots Per Inch for the X screen; for example:
    #
    #     Option "DPI" "75 x 85"
    #
    # will set the horizontal DPI to 75 and the vertical DPI to 85. By default,
    # the X driver will compute the DPI of the X screen from the EDID of any
    # connected display devices. See Appendix E for details. Default: string is
    # NULL (disabled).

    Option "NoFlip" "on"
    # Disable OpenGL flipping;
    # When OpenGL flipping is enabled, OpenGL can perform buffer
    # swaps by changing which buffer is scanned out rather than copying the
    # back buffer contents to the front buffer; this is generally a higher
    # performance mechanism and allows tearless swapping during the vertical
    # retrace (when __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK is set). Default: OpenGL
    # will swap by flipping when possible.

    Option "NoLogo" "on"
    # Disable drawing of the NVIDIA logo splash screen at X startup. Default:
    # the logo is drawn for screens with depth 24.

    Option "Interactive" "off"
    # This option controls the behavior of the driver's watchdog, which attempts
    # to detect and terminate GPU programs that get stuck, in order to ensure
    # that the GPU remains available for other processes. GPU compute
    # applications, however, often have long-running GPU programs, and killing
    # them would be undesirable. If you are using GPU compute applications and
    # they are getting prematurely terminated, try turning this option off.

    # When this option is set for an X screen, it will be applied to all X
    # screens running on the same GPU.

    # Default: on. The driver will attempt to detect and terminate GPU programs
    # that cause excessive delays for other processes using the GPU.

    Option "TripleBuffer" "off"
    # Enable or disable the use of triple buffering. If this option is enabled,
    # OpenGL windows that sync to vblank and are double-buffered will be given a
    # third buffer. This decreases the time an application stalls while waiting
    # for vblank events, but increases latency slightly (delay between user
    # input and displayed result).

    Option "ConnectToAcpid" "off"
    # The ACPI daemon (acpid) receives information about ACPI events like
    # AC/Battery power, docking, etc. acpid will deliver these events to the
    # NVIDIA X driver via a UNIX domain socket connection. By default, the
    # NVIDIA X driver will attempt to connect to acpid to receive these events.
    # Set this option to "off" to prevent the NVIDIA X driver from connecting to
    # acpid. Default: on (the NVIDIA X driver will attempt to connect to acpid).

    Option "EmulatedOverlaysThreshold" "off"
    # Enables the use of a threshold within the X server to perform the updates
    # to the emulated overlay or CI overlay. The emulated or CI overlay updates
    # can be deferred but this threshold will limit the number of deferred
    # OpenGL updates allowed before the overlay is updated. This option can be
    # used to trade off performance and animation quality. Default: on.

    Option "ForceFullCompositionPipeline" "on"
    # This option has the same possible values and semantics as
    # "ForceCompositionPipeline", but it additionally makes use of the
    # composition pipeline to apply ViewPortOut scaling.

    Option "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration" "on"
    # Normally, the NVIDIA X driver will fail to start if it cannot find any
    # display devices connected to the NVIDIA GPU.
    # AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration overrides that behavior so that the X
    # server will start anyway, even if no display devices are connected.

    # Enabling this option makes sense in configurations when starting the X
    # server with no display devices connected to the NVIDIA GPU is expected,
    # but one might be connected later. For example, some monitors do not show
    # up as connected when they are powered off, even if they are physically
    # connected to the GPU.

    # Another scenario where this is useful is in Optimus-based laptops, where
    # RandR 1.4 display offload (see Chapter 32) is used to display the screen
    # on the non-NVIDIA internal display panel, but an external display might be
    # connected later.

    # Default: off. The driver will refuse to start if it can't find at least
    # one connected display device.
